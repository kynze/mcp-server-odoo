        the SDK auto-enables protection ONLY when the bind host is loopback
        (``127.0.0.1``/``localhost``/``::1``); for any other bind — notably
        ``0.0.0.0``, the usual Docker setting — it leaves protection DISABLED

        ODOO_MCP_ALLOWED_HOSTS (and, as ``_warn_if_exposed`` says, front the

        When hosts are configured, an entry WITHOUT a port matches that host
        on any port — including the implicit 80/443 that browsers and reverse
        proxies omit from ``Host`` and ``Origin`` entirely. The SDK matches a

        to be listed alongside it; without it the documented
